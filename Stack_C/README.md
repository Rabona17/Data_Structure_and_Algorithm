# Stack in C

## Implementation:
Here I use an array of long to represent a stack. I have implemented several methods like `push`, `pop`,`top(peek)`, and etc. In the future, the stack can be implemented by a `circular Linkedlist`

## Techniques
Very careful use of pointers, and memory management strategies with the help of `Valgrind` and `GDB`.

# Self-Balanced BST in C++

## Features of C++ used:
* `template`, `operator overloading`, `class and inheritance`, `virtual functions`, `const function/parameter`, `friend`, `virtual`, etc

## Algorithm
When the binary search tree is unbalanced, we first remove the unbalanced node, and then reinsert it back.

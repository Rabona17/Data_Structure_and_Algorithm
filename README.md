# Data Structure and Algorithms in 4 languages
I have finished intermediate data structure and algorithm class in Python [(DSC20)](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/dsc20-winter-2019/class-schedule), and am going to take data structure in Java [(DSC30)](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/dsc30-fall-2018/class-schedule) and in C/C++ [(CSE12 Gary Version)](http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs12x/), and the upper-level **Advanced Data Structure** in [(CSE100)](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-100-winter-2019/schedule-and-assignments) and **Design of Algorithm** class in [(CSE101)](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-101-winter-2019/website-builder)

And might add R.(If I really hate data analysis)
## Works done
* `Stack and Queue` in Python
* `Circular Array` in Python 
* `LinkedList` & `Circular LinkedList` in Python
* `Doubly LinkedList` in Java
* `Tree` & `BST` and the corrosponding traversing/seaching/inserting/deleting algorithm in Python
* `Queue` using circular array in Java
* `Stack` in C
* A lot of `recursion`
## Next Step
* `Circular Linked_List` in C, `searching and sorting` algorithms in Java, `Hashtable` in C++
